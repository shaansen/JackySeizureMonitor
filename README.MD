# Epilepsy Journal

This project is intended to help dog owners record their dog's epilepsy events, manage them, and see patterns of improvement/deterioration with different medicines.

# Motivation

My family originally used pen-paper to record events and then fed them on a spreadsheet to understand any improvements. The core idea behind this app was to allow them to

- Record Events
- Manage them
- See patterns or trends

Being a data visualization enthusiast, I was interested in using charting libraries to answer some essential questions like :

- Does the introduction of any medicine reduce the severity of my dog's epilepsy?
- Does the introduction of any medicine cause any improvement in occurrences of the event?
